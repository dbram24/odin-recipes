        <h2>Description</h2>
        <!--Paragraph tag for description section-->
        <p><strong>Arayes</strong> are a popular Middle Eastern dish consisting of pita bread stuffed with spiced minced meat, typically lamb or beef. The meat is cooked raw inside the pita, and the dish is then grilled, baked, or pan-fried until the bread is crispy and the meat is cooked through.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 tbsp chopped parsley</li>
            <li>3 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>3 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>

        <!-- Ordered list for recipe steps -->
        <ol>
            <li>Grate the onion in a bowl using a standard box grater. We want the juices and all!</li>
            <li><strong>Meat filling</strong> - Add remaining meat filling ingredients. Mix well with your hands.</li>
            <li>Divide stuffing in 10 (about 55 to 60g per portion, 1/4 cup). Flatten into a semi-circle shape slightly smaller than the pita bread half.</li>
            <li><strong>Stuff</strong> - Gently open a pita then place the meat inside. Close, then press to spread to the edge and make it fairly evenly flat.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 50C/120F. Place a rack on a tray. (To keep cooked Arayes warm.)</li>
            <li>Heat a large frying pan over medium high heat. Spray both sides of the pita with olive oil then place 2 or 3 pieces in the pan (whatever you can fit). Cook for about 2 minutes on each side, pressing down lightly with a spatula, until golden and crispy. The meat is spread so thin it cooks really quickly!</li>
            <li>Transfer cooked Arayes onto the rack and put in the oven to keep warm. Cook remaining pita.</li>
            <li>Cut in half if desired (sometimes I do, sometimes I don't!). Pile Arayes onto a serving platter. Serve with Whipped Tahini sauce. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
