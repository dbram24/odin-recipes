        <ol>
            <li>Grate the onion in a bowl using a standard box grater. We want the juices and all!</li>
            <li><strong>Meat filling</strong> - Add remaining meat filling ingredients. Mix well with your hands.</li>
            <li>Divide stuffing in 10 (about 55 to 60g per portion, 1/4 cup). Flatten into a semi-circle shape slightly smaller than the pita bread half.</li>
            <li><strong>Stuff</strong> - Gently open a pita then place the meat inside. Close, then press to spread to the edge and make it fairly evenly flat.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 50C/120F. Place a rack on a tray. (To keep cooked Arayes warm.)</li>
            <li>Heat a large frying pan over medium high heat. Spray both sides of the pita with olive oil then place 2 or 3 pieces in the pan (whatever you can fit). Cook for about 2 minutes on each side, pressing down lightly with a spatula, until golden and crispy. The meat is spread so thin it cooks really quickly!</li>
            <li>Transfer cooked Arayes onto the rack and put in the oven to keep warm. Cook remaining pita.</li>
            <li>Cut in half if desired (sometimes I do, sometimes I don't!). Pile Arayes onto a serving platter. Serve with Whipped Tahini sauce. Enjoy!</li>
