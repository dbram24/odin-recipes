        <!--Paragraph tag for description section-->
        <p><strong>Asian Cucumber Salad</strong> is a refreshing and crunchy dish typically featuring thinly sliced cucumbers tossed in a flavorful dressing made with rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, and sometimes ginger and garlic.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <!--Unordered list for recipe components-->
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds Turkish, Persian or English cucumbers (about 5 cups sliced)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4-5 scallions, finely sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ginger, grated</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, finely minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, (for gluten-free use Bragg's Liquid Aminos or Coconut aminos)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup (or honey, or sugar), more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce (sambal olek) or sriracha, more to taste</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <!-- Ordered list for recipe steps -->
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned - about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
            <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice.</li>
        </ol>
